# Lab 30: Basic Sorting
- by Wyatt Pefley

## Description:
The assignment was to research and implement these sorting algorithms:


## Implementation:
The sorting algorithms take in one array and return those same values sorted.
## Algorithms
### Bubble-sort
  - Airty of one.
  - Time: O(n^2) where n = number of indexes O(n) if the array is already sorted
  - Space: O(1)
    
### insertion-sort
  - Airty of one.
  - Time: O(n^2) where n = number of indexes O(n) if the array is already sorted
  - Space: O(1)
    
### selection-sort.js
  - Airty of one.
  - Time: O(n^2) where n = number of indexes 
  - Space: O(1) 
       
## Testing
The test suite test each algorithm for 3 cases, all positive numbers, all negative numbers, and a mix of the two.
